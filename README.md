GameGuide is a web platform that suggests games based on the user's liked and disliked games.
Written as the final graduation project in IS school, due to the end of 2018.

Miek is a Progressive Web App based on [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). Most of its usage can be read in the boilerplate's docs, but it's enough saying you can setup the project like this:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:dll
npm start
```

This will fire the development mode with Webpack's Hot Reload.
